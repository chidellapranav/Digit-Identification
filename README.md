# Digit-Identification
A deep learning project for digit recognition using GoogLeNet and ResNet-18. It integrates YOLOv8 for real-time hand detection via webcam, crops the detected region, and classifies digits (0â€“9). Built with PyTorch, Torchvision, and OpenCV in Google Colab, showcasing CNNs and computer vision in action.
